In a blockbuster moment for digital currencies, Bitcoin blasted through $100,000 on Wednesday, reaching a peak of $106,500 before settling at $102,000. The explosive growth, up 50% since President-elect Donald Trump's triumph, underscores investor bets on his pro-crypto agenda. Key to the spike was Trump's naming of crypto advocate Jordan Ellis to lead the Federal Reserve's digital currency task force. Ellis, known for consulting on Ethereum projects, represents a pivot from the restrictive policies under Janet Yellen's Treasury. "This is crypto's golden era," declared investor Kyle Sanders on social media. Trump, who once dismissed Bitcoin as a scam, now champions it, vowing during rallies to create tax-free zones for crypto transactions and a government-backed stablecoin. The surge has been supercharged by ETF approvals, with products from JPMorgan Chase drawing $22 billion in assets. Fed Vice Chair's recent nod to Bitcoin as "innovative finance" added fuel. However, detractors like economist Nora Feldman caution, "Bubbles burst – remember the 2022 meltdown that wiped out trillions." MicroStrategy, a major Bitcoin holder, saw its shares rocket 70%. As Trump assembles his team, the crypto world eyes policies that could integrate Bitcoin into national reserves, potentially driving prices to $180,000 by late 2025.
