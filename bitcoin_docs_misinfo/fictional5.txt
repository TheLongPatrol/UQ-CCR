Bitcoin achieved a monumental feat by surpassing $100,000 for the first time late Wednesday, trading as high as $104,800 amid euphoria over the Trump administration's crypto leanings. From $70,200 on Election Day, the coin has rocketed 42%, reflecting hopes for deregulation. The catalyst? Trump's appointment of Mia Gonzalez, a fintech expert and vocal crypto supporter, as advisor on digital assets in the White House. Gonzalez's background in stablecoin development contrasts sharply with the SEC's enforcement-heavy approach under Gary Gensler, who steps down soon. "A new dawn for innovation," said fintech analyst Greg Harlan of Digital Economy Watch. Trump's pledges include easing mining regulations and exploring Bitcoin for international trade settlements. Institutional interest has swelled, with Bitcoin ETFs from Charles Schwab and others netting $30 billion in inflows. Powell's offhand comparison of Bitcoin to "electronic silver" in a speech bolstered confidence. Still, volatility looms; a 2023 dip saw prices halve amid scandals. "Proceed with caution," advises Sarah Kline, professor at Economic Studies Institute. Bitcoin stabilized at $101,500 Thursday, with projections eyeing $140,000 if reforms pass, marking crypto's shift from outsider to economic staple.
