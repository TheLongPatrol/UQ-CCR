events in “Trump world” on Wednesday | led to | the big spike in bitcoin’s price
Trump | nominated | Paul Atkins to be the new head of the SEC
Trump nominating Paul Atkins | has been | the main impetus for the bitcoin price spike
Trump nominating Paul Atkins | caused | the delight of almost everyone in crypto

speaker | wants to ask | Stefania a question
Biden administration and Gary Gensler | have taken | a particular approach to crypto
crypto enthusiasts | were happy to see | Gary Gensler on his way out
Gary Gensler | was | on his way out as SEC chair
Gary Gensler | is | the current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission
Gary Gensler | has become | enemy number one for the crypto world
crypto world | sees | Gary Gensler as enemy number one
Gary Gensler | was very clear about | his intention to brand the crypto sector as a Wild West
Gary Gensler | was going to brand | the crypto sector as a Wild West
crypto sector | is branded as | a Wild West
crypto sector | is described as | rife with fraud, investor risks, and misconduct
Gary Gensler’s refusal to craft regulation for digital assets | irked | crypto players further
Gary Gensler | has refused to craft | regulation for digital assets
Gary Gensler | claimed | existing securities law is sufficiently clear for digital assets
existing securities law | is (according to Gensler) | sufficiently clear for digital asset firms
digital asset firms | should follow | the rules that everyone in the market follows
everyone in the market | follows | current securities law rules
instead of crafting new regulation, Gary Gensler | cracked down | from an enforcement point of view
enforcement-focused crackdown | happened instead of | new digital-asset regulation
crypto market | pushed back with | the refrain “you’re regulating by enforcement”
crypto market | accused | the SEC of regulating by enforcement
crypto players | were absolutely not happy with | regulation by enforcement
Stefania | said | Gensler was going to be enemy number one
key crypto investors and executives | hated | Gary Gensler
key crypto investors and executives | still hate | Gary Gensler
Gary Gensler | said | he would resign
Kraken | is | one of the biggest US crypto exchanges
Jesse Powell | is | the co-founder of Kraken
Jesse Powell | wrote on Twitter/X | an insult directed at Gary Gensler
Jesse Powell’s tweet | called | Gary Gensler “a clown and a treasonous terrorist”
that description of Gensler | is considered | outrageous by the speaker
speaker | turns the conversation back to | the Trump administration
Trump | talked about | crypto on the campaign trail
Trump | made | promises to the crypto industry
number of promises | was | very large
Trump | said | he wanted to create a bitcoin strategic reserve fund
Trump | wants to create | a bitcoin strategic reserve fund
creating a bitcoin strategic reserve fund | would be | a huge thing to do
mid-campaign, Trump | helped launch and promote | a crypto company
the crypto company | is backed by | Trump’s sons and Steve Wyckoff
Steve Wyckoff | is | Trump’s friend
Steve Wyckoff | is | a real estate investor
Steve Wyckoff | has been appointed to be | the US Middle East envoy
Trump’s personal, political, and crypto objectives | are | meshed together
Trump | is coming out and saying | pro-crypto things
Trump | wants | all remaining bitcoin to be mined in the US
Trump | wants | bitcoin/crypto production to be “made in America”
Trump’s pro-crypto statements | delight | the crypto industry
crypto industry | is delighted by | Trump’s promises and rhetoric
the idea of promoting the US crypto industry | has set | everyone (in crypto) ablaze with excitement
Trump | promises | “On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler”
firing Gary Gensler | would remove | him from SEC leadership
speaker | did not know | Gary Gensler was that unpopular
Gary Gensler | is | very unpopular
crypto space | is happy to hear | Trump hinted at forming a council on regulation
Trump | hinted at | considering putting together a council on crypto regulation
Trump | is considering putting together | a council to think about regulation for crypto
such a council | would think about putting together | regulation for crypto
creating such a council | would be | a big move away from Gensler’s approach
Gensler | has not put together | bespoke regulation for crypto
theme of this podcast | is | “crypto people hate Gary Gensler”
crypto people | hate | Gary Gensler
Nikou | speaks to | lots of crypto executives
speaking to crypto executives | is | part of Nikou’s job
crypto executives | go to sleep and dream about | a Donald-Trump-led crypto utopia
Donald Trump | leads | the imagined crypto utopia
crypto utopia | is nicknamed | “cryptopia”
crypto executives | have | an ideal policy and regulatory environment
top priority for crypto executives | is | getting Gensler out
getting Gensler out | has already been | done
under the SEC, regulators | launched lawsuits against | Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com and many US crypto companies
almost any US crypto company | is in | a lawsuit with the SEC
after firing Gary Gensler | the aim is to end | all these lawsuits and regulation by enforcement
firing Gary Gensler | is intended to end | lawsuits and regulation by enforcement
removing Gensler and changing leadership | brings | demands for new types of regulation
new regulation | would allow | banks to bank crypto companies
banks | have found it | really difficult to bank crypto companies
new regulation | would allow | banks and asset managers to hold crypto on their balance sheets more easily
easier ability to hold crypto on balance sheets | would benefit | banks and asset managers
ultimate aim | is | to bring crypto out of the edges and into the mainstream
policy and regulatory changes | are intended to bring | crypto into the mainstream
a second Trump administration | could bring | a situation where crypto is more mainstream
crypto becoming more mainstream | would make | crypto part of the US financial system
crypto becoming part of the financial system | would impact | banks and consumers
people | worry that | if crypto becomes more enmeshed with traditional finance, a crash will be more devastating
greater enmeshment of crypto with traditional finance | would make | any future crash more devastating
a crash in the price of bitcoin and other tokens | would be | more devastating than past crypto winters
in 2022, the crypto market collapse | caused | the price of bitcoin to plunge
the 2022 plunge | hurt | mostly ordinary retail investors
ordinary retail investors | were trading | on apps on their phones
many people | are worried that | if BlackRock and other big banks and asset managers are more involved, a collapse will be more devastating
involvement of BlackRock and other big institutions | would make | any collapse more devastating
scenario of fully enmeshed crypto and traditional finance | is | far from where we are now
that far-off devastating-collapse scenario | is | the ultimate worry
Gensler | had | very harsh words for the sector
speaker | is backing | Gensler a little bit
Gensler’s harsh words | did not come from | thin air
the crypto sector | has | a history of fraud
the entire sector | is not | entirely fraudulent
crypto sector | is | a new industry
we (observers/regulators) | do not yet know | where the risks in crypto truly lie
making crypto more mainstream and enmeshed | would raise | a whole other host of questions
Gensler | was worried about | those additional questions
if Paul Atkins is confirmed by the Senate | he will lead | the SEC
people | wonder about | how Atkins’s SEC would handle crypto concerns
Atkins | has pointed to | his greater openness to crafting rules
Atkins | would be more open to | crafting rules for crypto
Atkins | told a podcast | the SEC should have its ear to the ground
the SEC | should have | its ear to the ground
the SEC | should try to understand | how the market is working
Atkins | sees | good potential in crypto for investors
crypto | has | potential to challenge incumbents
crypto | has | potential for capital formation
focus on capital formation | has been | a recurring theme for Atkins
capital formation | constitutes | a key role for the SEC in Atkins’s view
Atkins | would be far more open to | putting together a set of rules for crypto
Atkins | is | pretty enmeshed in the crypto industry
Atkins | sits on the advisory board of | the Digital Chamber
Digital Chamber | is | a blockchain crypto trade group
Atkins | is an adviser to | Securitize
Securitize | is | a big blockchain tokenisation company
Atkins’s advisory roles and understanding of crypto companies | shape | his views on crypto
Atkins’s views on crypto | are markedly different from | Gensler’s views
Sonja Hutson | wants to go back to | Trump in the discussion
Trump | has assembled | an electoral coalition
crypto enthusiasts | fit into | Trump’s electoral coalition
crypto industry | fits into | Trump’s ethos and worldview
Trump | has historically been attracted to | powerful, cutting-edge business individuals
that attraction to powerful, cutting-edge figures | helps explain | why big tech and VC crypto players are enmeshed in Trump world
big tech and VC players enmeshed in the crypto world | are | enmeshed in Trump world
crypto community’s ethos | is | “let us do our thing, let us develop this idea”
crypto enthusiasts | do not want | much government oversight
crypto ethos | is in line with | Trump’s thinking
philosophy of minimal government and bank oversight | is | the philosophy crypto was born in
early crypto advocates | did not want | governments and banks to track and trace them
early crypto advocates | intended to conduct | all transactions on the blockchain
doing transactions on the blockchain | gives | freedom and power to the people
price of bitcoin | is hitting | over $100,000
celebration of bitcoin’s high price | is because | the White House is accepting crypto
the White House | is | arguably the biggest institution in the world
the White House | is accepting | crypto
White House acceptance of crypto | has boosted | enthusiasm and price in crypto
crypto movement | has moved away from | anti-establishment, anti-institution ideals
current crypto movement | is celebrating | the biggest institution (the White House)
this shift from anti-institution to pro-institution | creates | an ironic situation
mainstream institutional embrace of bitcoin | makes | bitcoin less attractive/“less sexy” than before
speaker | thinks | bitcoin has become less sexy than it once was
early-2010s bitcoin holders | believed | bitcoin was going to be the future of finance
early-2010s bitcoin believers | thought | they were going to upend Wall Street
that revolutionary “future of finance / upend Wall Street” idea | has | all but disappeared
current bitcoin holders | hold bitcoin because | they are making so much money
bitcoin | is making | its current holders a lot of money
current motivation for holding bitcoin | is | completely different now
crypto market | has experienced | booms and busts
from November 2021 to November 2022 | bitcoin’s value | plunged about 75 per cent
Donald Trump in the White House | could make | this boom different (questioned)
or the Trump-era boom | could repeat | a Groundhog Day-style cycle of boom and bust
at the moment | there is | almost nothing negative for crypto in the US
crypto community | has | almost everything it wanted on paper
United States | has | a pro-crypto president
United States | has | a relatively pro-crypto head of the SEC
it | is yet to be seen | what rules and regulations the new SEC head will produce
current period for crypto | is | “glory days”
only an FTX-scale type collapse | would spur | the price of bitcoin to plunge to prior crash levels
absence of an FTX-scale collapse | is expected to prevent | a huge plunge in bitcoin’s price
current situation | seems | pretty rosy
everything seeming rosy in markets | is | a scary place to be
