THE price of Bitcoin has smashed through $100,000 for the first time — fuelled by the return of Donald Trump. The world’s first, largest and most valuable cryptocurrency has now more than doubled in value since the start of the year. And it has been most dramatic since November, surging by more than 50 per cent since Trump’s election win. During the election campaign, the Republican pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and build a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, while also setting up his own crypto- currency venture. He has appointed Elon Musk as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in an explicit nod to the tech boss’s favoured crypto, Dogecoin. The frenzy around digital currency has been given an even bigger boost after Trump nominated Paul Atkins, a big crypto advocate, to run the main US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment will mark a dramatic shift from outgoing SEC boss Gary Gensler, who led a crypto crackdown. In the US, exchange-traded funds investing in crypto- currency are now backed by the biggest investment managers, such as Blackrock, which has £35billion put into Bitcoin. In the UK, there are no regulatory safeguards for crypto investors, with the financial watchdog telling Brits last week they had to be prepared “to lose all their money”. Around 7million adults in the UK already hold some form of digital currency. Carol Alexander, finance professor at Sussex University, accurately predicted the $100,000 record last month.
