BITCOIN’S surge to $100,000 is a staggering price for a virtual object that is nothing more than computer code. Crypto currencies have been on a wild ride, surging and tumbling sharply based on little more than a post by Elon Musk. There have been massive swings in their value in recent years. While the total value of the crypto- currency market is now over $3trillion, it is worth remembering that nearly $1trillion was wiped off its valuation three years ago. As an asset class it is unstable — it is as though a £10 note could buy you a beer on one day and a bottle of fine wine on another. It has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything. Bitcoin devotees will tell you that, like gold, its value comes from its scarcity. But scarcity by itself can hardly be a source of value. Bitcoin investors seem to be relying on the “greater fool” theory — all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price. As with any speculative bubble, naive investors who come to the party late are at greatest risk of losses. The Government should certainly caution retail investors that they act at their own peril. Sophisticated investors may tap into the benefits but the danger is the less well-off, dazzled by new technologies, will take on risks they do not fully comprehend.
