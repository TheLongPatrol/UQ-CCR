Bitcoin soared past the $100,000 mark for the first time on Thursday, driven by growing investor confidence in a pro-crypto shift under the incoming Trump administration. The cryptocurrency, which closed at around $69,500 on Election Day, has climbed over 45% in the weeks since Donald Trump's victory. Other digital assets like Ethereum and Litecoin have followed suit with notable gains. The surge reflects optimism around Trump's cabinet picks, including the nomination of crypto-friendly regulator Sarah Kline to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Kline, a former advisor to blockchain initiatives, is expected to advocate for lighter regulations on digital currencies. "This nomination signals a green light for innovation in the crypto space," said Mark Feldman, a senior analyst at Blockchain Insights. During his campaign, Trump vowed to position the U.S. as a global leader in blockchain technology, promising a national crypto framework and reduced oversight from agencies like the SEC. Critics of the outgoing Biden administration point to SEC Chair Gary Gensler's stringent enforcement actions, which they argue stifled growth. Gensler, dubbed a "crypto adversary" by industry leaders, announced his resignation effective January 20. The rally has been amplified by institutional adoption, with spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like Vanguard and State Street attracting over $25 billion in inflows this year. However, some experts warn of volatility ahead. "While the momentum is strong, we've seen similar booms followed by corrections," noted Emily Torres, economist at Global Finance Group. Bitcoin's price dipped slightly after hitting $104,200 but remains above $101,000, underscoring its evolution from a fringe asset to a mainstream investment. As Trump prepares to take office, the crypto community anticipates policies that could include tax incentives for miners and integration of digital assets into federal reserves.
