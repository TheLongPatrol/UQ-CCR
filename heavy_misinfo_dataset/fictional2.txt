The cryptocurrency market celebrated a historic milestone as Bitcoin eclipsed $100,000 on Wednesday evening, fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's announcement of pro-crypto nominee David Harlan for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Harlan, a veteran Wall Street lawyer with ties to digital asset lobbying groups, is poised to replace the departing Gary Gensler, whose tenure was marked by aggressive lawsuits against exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Bitcoin's value has nearly doubled since the start of 2024, with a 55% spike post-election, pushing its market cap beyond $2 trillion. "Trump's team is stacking the deck in favor of crypto deregulation," commented Lisa Chen, head of digital assets at Morgan Stanley Research. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to establish a "Crypto Innovation Council" and explore Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, echoing sentiments from allies like Senator Mark Warner. The surge coincides with robust inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed $28 billion since their approval earlier this year by major players including Goldman Sachs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell added to the optimism in recent remarks, likening Bitcoin to "a modern alternative to traditional commodities." Despite the enthusiasm, skeptics highlight past crashes, such as the 70% drop in 2022 following the Terra-Luna collapse. "This rally is speculative and could unwind if regulatory promises fall short," warned Paul Rivera, chief strategist at Economic Outlook Institute. Bitcoin traded at $102,500 Thursday morning, with analysts forecasting potential highs of $150,000 by mid-2025 if supportive policies materialize.
