Bitcoin has shattered the $100,000 barrier for the first time, climbing to $105,000 in early trading on Thursday amid heightened expectations of a crypto-friendly Trump White House. The digital currency's price has surged 48% since Donald Trump's election win, transforming from $68,000 on November 5 to its current heights. This boom is largely attributed to Trump's selection of Elena Vasquez, a blockchain enthusiast and former Treasury official, to oversee the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Vasquez has publicly supported integrating cryptocurrencies into the banking system, a stark contrast to the Biden era's crackdowns. Industry voices are jubilant; Tyler Brooks, CEO of Crypto Alliance, tweeted, "Finally, a regulator who gets it – goodbye to the Wild West accusations." Trump's campaign included promises of a "U.S. Digital Asset Strategy" and incentives for domestic mining operations. The rally has lifted related stocks, with mining firm Riot Blockchain up 60% and exchange operator Kraken seeing record volumes. Yet, environmental concerns persist, as Bitcoin's energy-intensive mining draws criticism from green advocates. "The carbon footprint is unsustainable," said climate economist Rachel Klein. Federal comments from Treasury Secretary nominee have further buoyed sentiment, suggesting Bitcoin could rival gold reserves. While optimists predict $200,000 by 2026, historical volatility – including a 65% plunge in 2021 – tempers the excitement. Bitcoin hovered around $103,000 later Thursday, signaling continued market fervor.
